# Adversarial_Neural_Cryptography

This project is the implementation of research paper [“LEARNING TO PROTECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH ADVERSARIAL NEURAL CRYPTOGRAPHY”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918) 

It is the Computer Networks Project which covers the concepts of Network security, Encryption, Decryption, Convolutional Neural Networks and Tensorflow.

## Abstract:

- We make neural networks to learn to use secret keys to protect information from several other neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we focus on ensuring conﬁdentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary.

- Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eaves dropping on the communication between Alice and Bob.

- We do not prescribe speciﬁc cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially.

- We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet conﬁdentiality goals.
