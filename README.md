Implementation of research paper “LEARNING TO PROTECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH ADVERSARIAL NEURAL CRYPTOGRAPHY”

Computer Networks Project which covers the concepts of Network security, Encryption, Decryption, Convolutional Neural Networks and Tensorflow.

Abstract:
We make neural networks to learn to use secret keys to protect information from several other neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we focus on ensuring conﬁdentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary. Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eaves dropping on the communication between Alice and Bob. We do not prescribe speciﬁc cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet conﬁdentiality goals.
